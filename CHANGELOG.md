## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Layered configuration scaffolding** (`rules/global/README.md`, `rules/domain/README.md`, `project/project-manifest.md`) — introduced three-level constraint structure (Global Rules, Domain Rules, Project Context) with explicit repository templates.
- **Initialization protocol skill** (`skills/on_project_start/SKILL.md`) — first-entry workflow for environment scanning and dynamic boundary-questioning before implementation.
- **Example gallery profiles** (`examples/high-security-mode.md`, `examples/mvp-rapid-mode.md`, `examples/legacy-maintenance.md`) — ready-to-adapt constraint profiles for common operating modes.
- **Rules quickstart** (`docs/rules-quickstart.md`) — compact, first-pass rule-loading document for agents to reduce cognitive and token overhead.
- **Rule optimization roadmap** (`docs/rule-optimization-plan.md`) — phased plan for simplification, template expansion, and CI-based rule governance.
- **Domain rule templates** (`rules/domain/backend-api.md`, `rules/domain/frontend-components.md`, `rules/domain/cloud-infra.md`) — reusable rule skeletons with consistent rule schema.
- **Rule governance automation** (`scripts/lint-layered-rules.sh`, `.github/workflows/rule-governance.yml`) — lightweight layered-rule linting in CI for structure and override-format checks.
- **PR checklist for rule changes** (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) — explicit review checklist when layered rules are modified.

### Changed

- **TDAI requirement** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — behavior-changing work now requires test case definition before implementation.
- **ADR automatic update rule** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — architecture-changing work must update ADRs (or fallback decision record) in the same task.
- **Conflict resolution principle** (`docs/operating-rules.md`) — added explicit precedence: user instruction -> existing repo practice -> project context -> domain rules -> global rules.
- **Layered configuration documentation** (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/adoption-guide.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`) — synchronized guidance and adoption steps for split rule layers.
- **Layered configuration governance hardening** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `docs/layered-configuration.md`) — added placement rubric, deterministic conflict resolution algorithm, and layer hygiene guardrails to reduce rule drift and shadow conflicts.
- **Project override tracking format** (`project/project-manifest.md`) — added standardized `Overrides: <base-rule-id> -> <project-rule-id>` annotation and override registry table.
- **Domain layer guide** (`rules/domain/README.md`) — expanded with starter templates and recommended rule-entry schema.
- **Layered-rule linter integrity checks** (`scripts/lint-layered-rules.sh`, `rules/domain/*.md`) — added Rule ID uniqueness validation and superseded-replacement integrity checks via `Superseded by` field.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Agent-deference principle** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — the template now explicitly defers to agent-native capabilities (built-in safety rails, tool routing, output formatting) and only adds rules the agent tool does not provide. Items handled natively are marked `[AGENT-NATIVE]` for adoption-time trimming.
- **Trust level mechanism** (`docs/operating-rules.md`) — three tiers (`supervised`, `semi-auto` default, `autonomous`) plus an opt-in `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true` flag for fully unattended execution. Checkpoint activation matrix is 6 gates × 4 columns. Always-safe operations never require approval. Always-dangerous operations require approval by default even at `autonomous`; the bypass flag overrides this when the user explicitly accepts the risk.
- **Always-safe / always-dangerous operation lists** (`docs/operating-rules.md`) — absolute categorization: always-safe operations (read, test, lint, branch, diff) need no approval; always-dangerous operations (delete, drop, force-push, publish) require approval by default even at `autonomous`, overridable only with `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true`.

### Changed

- **Human checkpoint gates** (`docs/operating-rules.md`) — rewritten with a 4-column activation matrix (plan approval, critic review, mid-implementation checkpoint, scope-expansion, destructive-action, final-review) across supervised / semi-auto / autonomous / bypass. Always-dangerous operations are now "require approval by default" instead of "always require approval" — overridable with `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints`.
- **Validation loop** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — explicitly autonomous: test → lint → auto-fix → repeat runs without human approval. Escalation to human after 3 consecutive failures.
- **Context isolation** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`) — Medium tasks at `semi-auto`/`autonomous` may share planner + implementer context instead of requiring strict role isolation.
- **Compliance block** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — now trust-level-aware: required at `supervised`; optional for Small tasks at `semi-auto`/`autonomous`.
- **Small-task output contract** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — at `semi-auto`/`autonomous`, a brief summary suffices instead of the full structured output.
- **Demand triage workflow adaptation** (`skills/demand-triage/SKILL.md`) — Small task simplifications are now trust-level-qualified (compliance block, deliverable structure). Medium tasks gain context isolation relaxation note. Large task mid-implementation checkpoint respects `autonomous` trust level.
- **Critic review gate** (`docs/agent-playbook.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — at `autonomous` trust level, critic review is only mandatory for Large tasks.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Prompt budget trimming guide** (`docs/adoption-guide.md`) — five-step guide for adopting projects to self-trim: remove unused roles, remove unused skills, simplify format templates, configure Layer 2 loading strategy, and set up `prompt-budget.yml`. Includes per-action token savings estimates.
- **`prompt-budget.yml` configuration** (`skills/prompt-cache-optimization/SKILL.md`) — reference schema and agent usage rules for declaring enabled/disabled roles and skills, token budget targets per layer, and trimming thresholds. Agents read this file to respect the declared budget.
- **Format templates section** (`docs/agent-templates.md`) — canonical checkpoint, handoff artifact, context anchor, and deliverable templates moved from `docs/operating-rules.md`.
- **New skill: `prompt-cache-optimization`** (`skills/prompt-cache-optimization/SKILL.md`) — four-layer instruction loading order (static rules → stable skills → project state → volatile context) to maximize prompt cache hit rates across all LLM providers. Includes canonical skill sets per task type, file size guidelines, provider-specific notes (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, vLLM/SGLang), tool-specific adaptation patterns, and conformance self-check.
- **Tool definition stability** (`skills/prompt-cache-optimization/SKILL.md`) — new section covering deterministic tool ordering, task-type tool subsets, stable schemas, and the tool registry pattern for custom API callers.
- **Conversation memory tiering** (`skills/memory-and-state/SKILL.md`) — three-tier model: short-term (3–5 raw turns), mid-term (compressed summaries), long-term (persistent retrieval with optional RAG). Includes token budget guidelines (~8,500 tokens total).
- **Cache-aware loading step** (`docs/agent-playbook.md`) — added step 7 to mandatory workflow steps referencing the prompt cache skill.
- **Loading order hint** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — added instruction for Copilot agents to follow the four-layer loading order.

### Changed

- **Format template extraction** (`docs/operating-rules.md`) — replaced four verbose format blocks (checkpoint, handoff artifact, context anchor, deliverable structure) with one-line descriptions referencing `docs/agent-templates.md`. Saves ~500 tokens from Layer 1.
- **Common preamble replaced** (`docs/agent-templates.md`) — replaced ~400-token preamble with compact note referencing `docs/operating-rules.md` to eliminate duplication.
- **Demand classification condensed** (`docs/agent-templates.md`) — replaced inline criteria duplication with reference to `skills/demand-triage/SKILL.md`.
- **Cross-file deduplication** — collapsed duplicate definitions of three-layer architecture (`AGENTS.md`), instruction loading order (`docs/operating-rules.md`), compliance block and checkpoint gates (`docs/agent-playbook.md`), and mandatory workflow steps (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`). Each concept now has one source of truth; other files use brief references + links. Estimated savings: ~4,050 tokens per request.
- **Instruction loading order** (`docs/operating-rules.md`) — condensed to a 3-line summary referencing `skills/prompt-cache-optimization/SKILL.md` as the single source.
- **Three-layer architecture** (`AGENTS.md`) — replaced full definition with a compact index referencing `docs/agent-playbook.md`.
- **Compliance block and checkpoint gates** (`docs/agent-playbook.md`) — replaced inline definitions with references to `docs/operating-rules.md`.
- **Mandatory workflow** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — streamlined from 13 steps to 11, aligned with canonical loop.
- **Skill count** (`README.md`) — updated from 10 to 11.
- **Stale reference fix** (`skills/memory-and-state/SKILL.md`) — context anchor protocol now references `docs/agent-templates.md` (where the template was moved) instead of `docs/operating-rules.md`.
- **Conformance self-check precision** (`skills/prompt-cache-optimization/SKILL.md`) — 8 KB guideline now scoped to always-loaded files; on-demand skills may exceed with justification.
- **Agent preamble note** (`docs/agent-templates.md`) — rephrased auto-load assumption to conditional instruction for cross-tool accuracy.
- **Template consistency warning** (`docs/adoption-guide.md`) — Step 3 now warns adopters to update `docs/operating-rules.md` when simplifying templates.
- **Memory-and-state content optimization** (`skills/memory-and-state/SKILL.md`) — condensed categorized memory (3 subsections → 1 table), simplified contradiction detection and archive format blocks. 14,748 → 13,237 bytes (−10%).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Memory lifecycle management** (`skills/memory-and-state/SKILL.md`) — added decision archive rules (when/how to move stale entries to `DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md`), selective read strategy (tiered reading table for decisions, architecture memory, session memory), session memory hygiene (promotion rule, cleanup cadence), and memory health indicators (thresholds and actions).
- **Decision archive lifecycle** (`docs/operating-rules.md`) — added archive lifecycle subsection under decision log guidance; expanded mandatory read-before-write to include archive search for legacy module tasks.
- **Archive-aware contradiction detection** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — updated steps 4–5 so agents search `DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md` when working on legacy modules or when no match is found in active decisions.
- **Periodic memory health check** (`docs/adoption-guide.md`) — added step 7 to the maintenance loop for threshold-triggered memory hygiene, with periodic review as a low-volume backstop.

### Changed

- **Record step update** (`docs/agent-playbook.md`) — Record step now includes a lifecycle maintenance check via the `memory-and-state` skill.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Workflow clarity hardening** (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`) — defined the loop as a canonical superset and required explicit path selection after triage so Small path simplification is not interpreted as implicit step skipping.
- **Verifiable first-response requirement** (`docs/agent-playbook.md`, `docs/operating-rules.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — added a mandatory compliance block (read set, scale, path decision, checkpoint map) before implementation starts.
- **Small-path minimum output contract** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `skills/demand-triage/SKILL.md`) — codified non-skippable explicit outputs for Small tasks: preamble, contradiction check result, validation reporting, and concise deliverable structure.
- **Feedback loop governance** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `docs/agent-templates.md`) — added task-end mini retrospectives, rolling quality signals, and escalation triggers so process quality is continuously measured and corrected.

### Changed

- **Core workflow synchronization** (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — aligned loop and step ordering around `Discover → Triage → ... → Summarize`, and synchronized mandatory workflow guidance across docs.
- **Small-task deliverable rule consistency** (`docs/agent-playbook.md`, `skills/demand-triage/SKILL.md`, `docs/agent-templates.md`) — clarified that mandatory deliverable structure remains required for Small tasks, but can be concise; summary is additional, not a replacement.
- **Context compaction guidance** (`docs/operating-rules.md`, `skills/memory-and-state/SKILL.md`) — added compaction protocol and workflow synchronization guardrail to reduce drift and stale instruction risk.
- **Skill quality upgrades** (`skills/application-implementation/SKILL.md`, `skills/backend-change-planning/SKILL.md`, `skills/error-recovery/SKILL.md`, `skills/feature-planning/SKILL.md`, `skills/test-and-fix-loop/SKILL.md`) — added conformance self-checks; expanded testing guidance with scale-aware strategy and test-first recommendations.
- **Decision log update** (`DECISIONS.md`) — recorded the adaptive-workflow decision and corrected context wording to match actual process.
