Example:

`Overrides: API-002 -> PROJECT-API-001`

## Override registry

| Base Rule ID | Project Rule ID | Reason | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  | active |

Define path-based domain rule masking. Leave empty or remove this section to load all domain rules unconditionally.

| Path glob | Active domain rules | Masked domain rules |
