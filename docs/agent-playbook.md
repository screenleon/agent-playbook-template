# Agent Playbook

## Three-layer architecture

All agent work follows three layers:

1. **Rules** (`docs/operating-rules.md`) — hard constraints: safety, scope, codebase discovery, validation loop, error recovery, project-specific constraints, decision log.
2. **Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`) — reusable capabilities: repo exploration, test-and-fix loop, error recovery, memory management, plus domain skills (planning, backend, frontend, design, docs).
3. **Loop** — every implementation follows: Discover → **Triage** → Plan → **Critique** → **Approve** → Implement → Test → Fix → Repeat → Record → **Summarize**.

## Repository asset map

- Global entrypoint: `AGENTS.md`
- Project subagents: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Reusable templates: `docs/agent-templates.md`
- Reusable skills: `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Repo-wide Copilot instructions: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Decision log: `DECISIONS.md` (created per repo)
- Architecture overview: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (created per repo)

## Source of truth and precedence

Use this precedence order when documents overlap:

1. `docs/operating-rules.md` for safety, scope control, validation, and destructive-action rules
2. `docs/agent-playbook.md` for routing, role definitions, and workflow ownership
3. `AGENTS.md` as the short root entrypoint into those two files
4. `docs/agent-templates.md` as reusable prompt scaffolds
5. `.claude/agents/`, `skills/`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as tool-specific implementations of the same role model

If a tool-specific file drifts from the source-of-truth docs (`docs/operating-rules.md` and this playbook), update the tool-specific file to match them.

## Tool portability

The role names in this template are conceptual. Different tools expose them differently:

- Claude-style tooling can map them into `.claude/agents/*`
- Copilot-style tooling can reference them through repository instructions and prompt files
- Codex-style or generic chat tooling can use the same role names through prompt templates and local repo docs

Do not assume every tool supports named subagents. Keep the role model stable even when the implementation surface changes.

## Default routing

### Use the planning agent first when

- a request impacts more than one module
- a request changes API contracts, schemas, migrations, events, or background jobs
- a request touches auth, permissions, audit, uploads, security, or notifications
- a request is still ambiguous and needs scope, order, or risk clarification
- a request is driven by screenshots or mockups and also changes flow or state

### Use specialist agents directly when

- backend contract and domain work is isolated
- general application or frontend implementation is isolated and does not need a planning-first phase
- image-led UI implementation is isolated
- integration work is mostly wiring existing pieces together
- documentation is the primary deliverable
- final review is focused on bugs, security, and regressions

## Role definitions

### `feature-planner`

- defines scope, non-goals, impacted modules, dependencies, order, and validation
- owns ambiguity reduction before implementation starts

### `backend-architect`

- owns contract-first backend design, schema changes, permissions, audit, and high-risk backend behavior

### `application-implementer`

- owns general product implementation that is neither pure backend architecture nor mostly integration wiring
- covers ordinary frontend, service-layer, or app behavior work where a dedicated image-led flow is unnecessary

### `ui-image-implementer`

- owns design-to-code tasks driven by screenshots, mockups, or visual specs

### `integration-engineer`

- owns wiring across API, state, navigation, side effects, caching, and complete user journeys

### `documentation-architect`

- owns repository instructions, onboarding docs, ADRs, runbooks, process docs, and architecture explanations
- optimizes for long-term maintainability and future agent readability
- responsible for automatic maintenance of `DECISIONS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and project-specific constraints as a side effect of code changes

### `risk-reviewer`

- owns bug finding, regression detection, permission review, security review, and testing gaps
- also provides **early risk assessment during planning** for high-risk work (schema migrations, auth changes, payment logic, public API changes, cross-service changes)

### `critic`

- adversarial design reviewer invoked **after** a planner or architect produces a proposal and **before** the user decides
- challenges proposals for over-engineering, hidden coupling, missing edge cases, constraint violations, scope creep, and unstated assumptions
- does not rewrite proposals — states what is wrong and lets the proposer fix it
- separate from `risk-reviewer`: critic challenges design quality; risk-reviewer checks implementation safety

## Suggested workflow

### Mandatory steps for all workflows

Every workflow below implicitly includes these steps:

1. **Discover** — run the `repo-exploration` skill before coding
2. **Triage** — run the `demand-triage` skill to classify task scale (Small / Medium / Large) based on evidence from discovery. This determines which subsequent steps are mandatory vs. optional. See `skills/demand-triage/SKILL.md` for classification criteria and workflow adaptation rules
3. **Structured preamble** — state assumptions, constraints, and proposed approach before producing output (see `docs/operating-rules.md` structured output rules). For Small tasks, this may be inline (1–2 sentences)
4. **Validate** — run the `test-and-fix-loop` skill after every code change. For Small tasks, run only targeted tests for the changed file
5. **Recover** — use the `error-recovery` skill when anything fails
6. **Record** — use the `memory-and-state` skill to log decisions and update architecture docs
7. **Isolate** — each role runs in a separate context. Pass structured handoff artifacts between roles, not raw conversation history (see Context isolation section below). Small tasks typically need only one agent, so isolation is trivially satisfied
8. **Deliver** — produce output using the mandatory deliverable structure (see `docs/operating-rules.md` → Mandatory deliverable structure). For Small tasks, keep the required structure concise rather than replacing it
9. **Summarize** — after completing any task, produce a brief task completion summary for memory (see `docs/agent-templates.md` → Task completion summary). This summary is additional to the required deliverable structure and enables future pattern reuse and prevents context loss across sessions

### First-response compliance block (mandatory)

In the first response of a task, make compliance visible by explicitly stating:

1. **Read set** — which source-of-truth files were read for this task
2. **Scale classification** — `[SCALE: SMALL|MEDIUM|LARGE]` with 1-2 sentence evidence-based reason
3. **Path decision** — whether this task uses Small simplification or Medium/Large planning path, and why
4. **Checkpoint expectations** — which mandatory checkpoints will apply in this run (or `N/A` with reason)

Do not start implementation before this block is present.

### Mandatory checkpoint gates

These gates require the agent to **STOP and wait for user approval**:

- **After planning, before implementation** — the planning agent presents its plan; the critic challenges it; then the user approves. Implementation agents do not start until the user confirms.
- **On scope expansion** — if implementation reveals the need to change more modules or contracts than planned, stop and request approval for the expanded scope.
- **On contradiction** — if the proposed work contradicts `DECISIONS.md`, stop and present the conflict.
- **On stuck** — after 3 failed fix attempts, stop and escalate.

See `docs/operating-rules.md` → Human checkpoint gates for the full list and format.

### New feature

`feature-planner` → `critic` → **user decision** → `backend-architect`, `application-implementer`, and/or `ui-image-implementer` → `integration-engineer` → `documentation-architect` as needed → `risk-reviewer`

### High-risk backend change

`feature-planner` → `critic` → `risk-reviewer` (plan assessment) → **user decision** → `backend-architect` → `risk-reviewer` (final review)

### Small change

If the `demand-triage` skill classifies the task as Small:

`application-implementer` (with inline 1–2 sentence plan) → targeted validation only

No planning agent, critic, or risk-reviewer required. The implementer reads the file, states the change in 1–2 sentences, implements, and runs targeted tests. See `skills/demand-triage/SKILL.md` for the full list of what is mandatory vs. optional on the Small path.

Small means **simplified**, not **implicit**. Even on the Small path, the following remain explicit and mandatory:

1. First-response compliance block
2. Structured preamble (inline 1–2 sentences is acceptable)
3. DECISIONS.md contradiction check outcome
4. Validation plan and targeted verification result
5. Mandatory deliverable structure (concise is allowed; omission is not)

### General application change

If it is bounded and low ambiguity (Medium scale):

`application-implementer` → `risk-reviewer`

If it also changes flow, state, or contracts:

`feature-planner` → `critic` → **user decision** → `application-implementer` → `integration-engineer` → `risk-reviewer`

### Image-led UI change

If it is visual only:

`ui-image-implementer` → `risk-reviewer`

If it also changes logic or flow:

`feature-planner` → `critic` → **user decision** → `ui-image-implementer` → `integration-engineer` → `risk-reviewer`

### Documentation-heavy change

`feature-planner` as needed → **user approval** → `documentation-architect` → `risk-reviewer` when technical correctness matters

## Context isolation

Each agent role must run in its own context (separate invocation, session, or subagent call). Do not chain roles in a single long conversation.

### Why

Role switching within one context causes:
- **Context drift** — the agent forgets which role it is playing
- **Long-task loss of control** — instructions from early in the conversation are ignored
- **Memory contamination** — reasoning from one role leaks into and distorts the next

### How

- Each step in a workflow is a **separate agent invocation**.
- Agents communicate through **handoff artifacts** (see `docs/operating-rules.md` → Context isolation → Handoff artifact), not through shared conversation history.
- If the tool does not support separate sessions, insert a hard context break: summarize the output into a handoff artifact and restart with only that artifact.

### Workflow with context boundaries

```
[Context 1] feature-planner → produces plan artifact
[Context 2] critic → receives plan artifact → produces critique artifact
[User]      reviews plan + critique → decides
[Context 3] backend-architect → receives approved plan → produces implementation
[Context 4] risk-reviewer → receives implementation summary → produces review
```

Each `[Context N]` is an isolated invocation. No context carries forward except through explicit handoff artifacts.

## Ownership principles

- Planning agents define scope, order, dependencies, and validation.
- Implementation agents stay inside their domain and avoid unnecessary expansion.
- Integration agents close loops across state, navigation, side effects, and data flow.
- Documentation agents keep instructions, architecture notes, and operational docs aligned with the actual workflow.
- Review agents lead with findings, not summaries.

## Maintenance principles

- Keep root guidance short and stable.
- Put details in focused docs, agents, and skills.
- Promote repeated prompts into reusable templates.
- Keep templates generic unless a repository-specific constraint truly matters.
- Prefer one conceptual role model with many tool-specific implementations, not many unrelated role models.
