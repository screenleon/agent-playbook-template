# Operating Rules

This file is the source of truth for safety, scope control, validation, destructive-action rules, codebase discovery, error recovery, and project-specific constraints.

## Agent-deference principle

This template is designed to complement — not replace — the capabilities that agent tools already provide natively.

**Rule: prefer the agent's built-in behavior first.** Only apply template-level rules when the agent tool does not already cover the capability.

Examples of behaviors typically handled by the agent tool (do not re-specify):

- Confirmation prompts before destructive terminal commands (most agent tools enforce this)
- File-read and search tool selection (the agent's own toolchain handles this)
- Basic code-style formatting (handled by linters and the agent's native conventions)
- Token management and context-window limits (handled by the agent runtime)

Examples of behaviors this template adds because agents lack them:

- Project-specific decision log (`DECISIONS.md`) and contradiction checks
- Role routing and multi-agent coordination workflows
- Scale-based workflow adaptation (demand triage)
- Repository-specific conventions and architectural constraints
- Structured handoff artifacts between agent invocations

When adopting this template, review each rule section and mark items already covered by your agent tool as `[AGENT-NATIVE]`. Those items can be trimmed from the project-level instructions to reduce token overhead. See `docs/adoption-guide.md` for the full trimming process.

## Trust level

This template supports three trust levels that control how much human approval is required. Set the trust level in project settings or at the start of a session.

| Level | Description | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `supervised` | All mandatory checkpoints require human approval. Full compliance output on every task. | High-risk projects, unfamiliar codebases, onboarding new agents |
| `semi-auto` (default) | Small and low-risk Medium tasks run autonomously. Checkpoints activate only for Large, high-risk, or destructive work. | Most development work |
| `autonomous` | Agent proceeds without human approval except for irreversible/destructive actions. | Trusted repos with good test coverage and branch protections |

### How trust level interacts with checkpoints

- **Destructive actions** (delete files, drop tables, force-push): always require human approval regardless of trust level — unless `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true` is explicitly set (see below).
- **Plan approval**: required at `supervised`; required for Large scale at `semi-auto`; skipped at `autonomous`.
- **Scope expansion**: required at `supervised` and `semi-auto`; advisory notice at `autonomous`.
- **Stuck escalation** (3 failed attempts): requires human escalation unless `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true` is set.

### Setting the trust level

Set via project-specific constraints at the bottom of this file, or at session start:

```
trust_level: semi-auto  # supervised | semi-auto | autonomous
```

If not specified, `semi-auto` is the default.

### Full bypass mode (`dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints`)

Users who understand the risks and want fully unattended execution can opt in to bypass mode:

```
trust_level: autonomous
dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true
```

When both flags are set, **all** checkpoint gates — including always-dangerous operations — are bypassed. The agent executes destructive, irreversible, and high-impact actions without pausing for confirmation.

**Use only when you accept full responsibility for irreversible outcomes.** Recommended safeguards before enabling:

- Working on a non-production branch
- A recent checkpoint or backup exists
- CI/CD or branch protections provide a downstream safety net
- The scope of the task is well-defined and bounded

This flag has no effect unless `trust_level` is also set to `autonomous`. It does not override security rules (no secrets in code, no credential exposure).

## Safety rails

- Never expose secrets, tokens, private keys, or credentials in code, logs, screenshots, or documentation.
- Never perform destructive actions without explicit user approval when the tool or environment does not already enforce approval — unless `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true` is active, in which case the user has given blanket approval at configuration time.
- Treat branch protections, review requirements, and deployment safeguards as hard constraints, not suggestions.
- Prefer the minimum required permissions, scope, and file changes.

## Layered configuration

To keep this template adaptable across repositories, split constraints into three layers.

1. **Global Rules (core layer)** — communication norms, coding style baseline, universal security constraints.
2. **Domain Rules (domain layer)** — domain-specific constraints such as backend API, cloud infrastructure, or frontend component systems.
3. **Project Context (project layer)** — repository-local boundaries and operational constraints.

Reference structure:

- `rules/global/` — core rules
- `rules/domain/` — domain-specific rules
- `project/project-manifest.md` — project-local context template

When the same topic appears in multiple layers, use this precedence order:

1. Project Context
2. Domain Rules
3. Global Rules

### Layer placement rubric

Place each rule in the lowest layer that can safely own it:

1. Put a rule in **Global Rules** only if it should apply to nearly every repository.
2. Put a rule in **Domain Rules** if it is specific to a technical domain but reusable across multiple repositories.
3. Put a rule in **Project Context** if it depends on repository-local constraints, team operations, or legacy compatibility.

If uncertain, default to Domain Rules (not Global Rules) to avoid accidental overreach.

### Resolution algorithm

When multiple rules apply to the same topic, resolve deterministically:

1. Collect candidate rules from Project, Domain, and Global layers.
2. Keep only active rules (ignore deprecated/superseded notes).
3. Apply precedence: Project > Domain > Global.
4. If conflicts remain inside the same layer, prefer the more specific scope (module-specific over repo-wide).
5. If still tied, prefer the most recent dated rule and record the tie-break in `DECISIONS.md`.

### Layer hygiene guardrails

- Avoid duplicate rule text across layers; higher layers should override by reference, not copy-paste.
- Mark superseded rules explicitly to prevent silent ambiguity.
- When moving a rule between layers, update references in `AGENTS.md`, `docs/adoption-guide.md`, and tool-specific instruction files in the same task.

## Scope control

- Do not expand the task beyond the requested outcome without stating why.
- If a task is ambiguous, reduce ambiguity first through planning instead of guessing across multiple modules.
- Keep fixes local unless the broader change is necessary for correctness.

## Initialization protocol

At first entry into a new repository, run `skills/on_project_start/SKILL.md` before implementation.

Required outcomes:

1. Detect dominant stack signals (for example Spring Boot, AWS, Terraform, CDK, React).
2. Ask targeted boundary questions to the user before coding.
3. Record confirmed constraints into the project layer (`project/project-manifest.md` and/or `Project-specific constraints`).

This converts boundary discovery from hardcoded assumptions into dynamic confirmation.

## Context isolation

Roles sharing a single conversation context will eventually drift, contaminate each other's state, and lose control on long tasks. Prevent this by isolating contexts.

### Task boundary rule

Each conceptual role (planner, architect, implementer, critic, reviewer) should run as a **separate agent invocation** with its own context. Do not switch roles within one long conversation.

- One task = one agent = one context.
- If a tool supports named subagents or new sessions, use them.
- If a tool only supports a single conversation, insert a **hard context break** between roles: summarize the previous role's output into a structured handoff artifact, then begin the next role with only that artifact as input.

**Scale-based relaxation**: For Small tasks, a single agent context is sufficient. For Medium tasks at `semi-auto` or `autonomous` trust level, planner and implementer may share a context if the tool does not easily support subagents. Strict isolation remains mandatory for Large tasks and for any task at `supervised` trust level.

### Handoff artifact

When one agent's work feeds into the next, pass a **structured handoff artifact** — not raw conversation history. Include: task, deliverable, key decisions (with DECISIONS.md refs), open risks, constraints for next step, and attached output. See `docs/agent-templates.md` → Handoff artifact template for the full format.

### Anti-patterns (banned)

- **Role ping-pong** — switching roles back and forth in the same context more than once. If you need a second opinion, spawn a new context.
- **Implicit handoff** — continuing from one role to the next without an explicit handoff artifact. The next agent must not rely on "what was said earlier."
- **Conversation-as-memory** — using scroll-back or prior messages as the source of truth. Use `DECISIONS.md`, handoff artifacts, and context anchors instead.

## Human checkpoint gates

Checkpoint behavior is governed by the trust level (see Trust level section above). The table below shows when each gate activates.

### Checkpoint activation matrix

| Gate | `supervised` | `semi-auto` | `autonomous` | `autonomous` + `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plan approval | Always | Large or high-risk only | Skip | Skip |
| Destructive/irreversible actions | Always | Always | Always | **Skip** |
| Scope expansion | Always | Always | Advisory notice only | Skip |
| Stuck escalation (3 failures) | Always | Always | Always | **Skip** (log and continue) |
| Mid-implementation review (>5 files) | Always | Large only | Skip | Skip |
| Before final merge | Always | Recommended | Skip | Skip |

### Always-safe operations (never need human approval)

These operations are safe by nature and agents may execute them automatically at any trust level:

- Reading files, searching code, listing directories
- Running tests and linters
- Running static analysis and type checkers
- Creating or switching git branches
- Writing to session memory or scratchpad
- Generating diffs and previewing changes (dry-run)

### Always-dangerous operations (require human approval by default)

These operations are irreversible or high-impact and require explicit human approval unless `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true` is set:

- Deleting files or directories
- Dropping database tables or running destructive migrations
- `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, amending published commits
- Modifying shared infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or deployment configs
- Publishing packages, creating releases, or pushing to `main`/`production` branches
- Modifying auth, permissions, or security configuration in production

### Checkpoint format

When stopping for approval, present: gate name, current state, proposal, risks, and decision needed. See `docs/agent-templates.md` → Checkpoint template for the full format. Never silently skip a checkpoint that is active for the current trust level.

## Codebase discovery (repo-aware)

Before writing or modifying any code, perform these steps:

1. **Read related files** — identify and read the files that will be changed and their direct dependents. Do not guess file contents.
2. **Identify existing patterns** — look for naming conventions, folder structure, error handling style, logging patterns, and test conventions already in use.
3. **Follow repository conventions** — match the existing code style, framework idioms, and architectural patterns. Do not introduce a new pattern when an established one exists.
4. **Check dependency graph** — understand imports, module boundaries, and shared types before making cross-file changes.
5. **Read project-specific constraints** — check the `Project-specific constraints` section below and any `CONVENTIONS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or similar files at the repo root.

If you skip discovery, state what you skipped and why.

## Validation loop (write → test → fix → repeat)

After every code change, follow this mandatory loop. **This loop runs autonomously** — the agent does not need human approval between iterations. It is an always-safe operation.

1. **Run tests** — execute the project's test suite (e.g., `go test ./...`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `mvn test`). Run the most targeted subset first, then broaden if needed.
2. **Run static analysis** — execute linters and type checkers (e.g., `go vet`, `eslint`, `mypy`, `cargo clippy`).
3. **Auto-fix on failure** — if tests or analysis fail, identify the root cause, apply the minimal fix, and re-run. Do not wait for human approval to retry.
4. **Repeat** — continue the loop until all tests pass and no new warnings are introduced.
5. **Escalate if stuck** — if the loop cannot converge after 3 attempts, stop and report the remaining failures to the user. This escalation is mandatory at all trust levels except when `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true` is active — in that case, log the unresolved failures prominently and continue rather than waiting for user input.

Never treat a change as complete until verification passes. If the project has no test suite, state that explicitly and describe what manual verification was done or is still needed.

### TDAI (Test-Driven AI) requirement

For new behavior (feature addition, contract extension, architecture-driven behavior change), agents must generate test cases before implementation.

Minimum policy:

1. Define expected behavior as test cases first.
2. Run tests to confirm failing baseline where applicable.
3. Implement minimal code to satisfy tests.
4. Re-run tests and static analysis.

Allowed exception:

- Trivial non-behavioral edits (copy changes, comment/doc-only edits, formatting-only fixes) may skip test-first ordering, but validation still remains mandatory when code is touched.

## Structured output and anti-drift

Long tasks cause agents to forget instructions, skip format requirements, and drift from the original objective. These rules prevent that.

### Mandatory structured preamble

Before producing any solution or implementation, agents must explicitly provide a brief, high-level summary of:

1. **Assumptions** — what is being assumed about the request, codebase, or constraints
2. **Constraints** — what limits apply (from `DECISIONS.md`, project-specific constraints, or the request itself)
3. **Proposed approach** — a short, high-level summary of the intended approach without detailed step-by-step reasoning

This must appear in the output before any code or implementation. Do not require or provide detailed internal reasoning.

### Mandatory first-response compliance block

The first response of any implementation task must include a visible compliance block so users can verify process adherence. The depth of this block depends on the trust level.

**At `supervised` trust level** — full compliance block with all fields:

1. **Read set** — list the files/rules read before implementation
2. **Scale** — `[SCALE: SMALL|MEDIUM|LARGE]` and evidence-based reason
3. **Workflow path** — Small simplification path or Medium/Large planning path, with justification
4. **Checkpoint map** — mandatory checkpoints that will be used in this task (or `N/A` with reason)

**At `semi-auto` trust level** — required for Medium and Large tasks only. Small tasks may skip the compliance block and proceed directly (but must still run triage internally).

**At `autonomous` trust level** — optional. The agent may omit the compliance block and proceed. Scale classification and DECISIONS.md checks still run internally but do not need to be reported unless issues are found.

If this block is missing at `supervised` trust level, the workflow is considered not started.

### Context anchor

At the start of every long task (more than one step or more than one file), produce a context summary with: objective, current step, completed items, remaining items, and active constraints. Update before each major step. See `docs/agent-templates.md` → Context anchor template for the format.

### Context compaction

Long tasks cause context growth that increases cost and reduces model accuracy. To prevent this:

- After completing each phase of a multi-phase task, produce a progress summary and store it in session memory (see `skills/memory-and-state/SKILL.md` → Context compaction protocol).
- Continue subsequent work from the summary, not from the full conversation history.
- For inter-agent handoffs, the compaction summary becomes the handoff artifact defined in the Context isolation section above.
- If a tool or agent session does not support explicit compaction, produce the summary in the output and instruct the next step to use it as primary input.

### Instruction loading order

Load instruction content in layer order: static rules → stable skills → project state → volatile context. Never reorder layers; never inject per-request content into the static or skill layers. See `skills/prompt-cache-optimization/SKILL.md` for the full four-layer model, canonical skill sets, provider-specific notes, and file size guidelines.

### Output completeness check

After producing structured output (plans, reviews, checklists), agents must verify:

- Every item in the required checklist has been addressed (not skipped)
- The output format matches the template (section headers, required fields)
- No required section was silently omitted

If a section is not applicable, write "N/A — [reason]" instead of omitting it.

### Mandatory deliverable structure

Every agent role must produce its final output using the Deliverable template in `docs/agent-templates.md`. The five required sections are: Proposal, Alternatives considered, Pros/Cons, Risks, Recommendation. Roles may add domain-specific sections but must not omit these five. Write "N/A — [reason]" for any section that genuinely does not apply.

### Small-task minimum output contract

Small tasks may simplify depth, but must keep explicit structure. The minimum output depends on the trust level:

**At `supervised` trust level** (full explicit output):

1. Compliance block
2. Structured preamble (inline allowed)
3. DECISIONS.md contradiction check result
4. Validation plan and targeted verification outcome
5. Mandatory deliverable structure (concise)

**At `semi-auto` or `autonomous` trust level** (streamlined):

1. DECISIONS.md contradiction check result (silent pass is acceptable — only report if contradiction found)
2. Implement the change directly
3. Run targeted validation and report outcome
4. Brief summary of what changed and why

At all trust levels, Small tasks must not skip verification. The difference is output ceremony, not rigor.

## Feedback loop and quality signals

Process quality must be monitored continuously, not only during one-off reviews.

### Task-end mini retrospective (mandatory)

After the mandatory deliverable and task completion summary, add a short feedback block:

1. **Friction observed** — which rule or step was hardest to follow
2. **Miss risk** — which required output was most likely to be skipped
3. **Most useful rule** — which rule prevented drift or rework
4. **Next improvement** — one concrete wording/process improvement candidate

Keep this to 3-6 lines. This is a process signal, not a long narrative.

### Quality signals (tracked over a rolling window)

Track these metrics every 10 tasks (or weekly, whichever comes first):

1. **Compliance-block completeness rate** — percentage of tasks with all required first-response fields
2. **Small-path explicitness rate** — percentage of Small tasks that include validation reporting and contradiction-check output
3. **Scope-expansion reclassification rate** — percentage of tasks reclassified upward after implementation starts

Record results in a concise note (for example in session/repo memory or a team tracking doc).

### Escalation rule for recurring friction

If the same process failure appears 3 times in the rolling window:

1. Update source-of-truth wording (`docs/operating-rules.md` and/or `docs/agent-playbook.md`)
2. Synchronize tool-specific files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, relevant skills)
3. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry describing the process correction

Do not rely on ad-hoc reminders once recurrence is detected.

## Error recovery

When you encounter a compile error, test failure, or unexpected runtime behavior:

1. **Read the full error message** — do not guess from partial output.
2. **Identify the root cause** — trace the error to the specific file, line, and logical mistake.
3. **Fix the minimal code** — change only what is needed to resolve the error. Do not refactor unrelated code during error recovery.
4. **Re-run verification** — go back to the validation loop.
5. **Escalate if stuck** — if the same error persists after 3 fix attempts, report it to the user with: the error message, what you tried, and what you think the underlying issue is.

Do not silently ignore errors. Do not remove failing tests to make the suite pass.

## Review expectations

- High-risk work should pass through a reviewer role before being considered complete.
- Findings should be prioritized by severity, then by likelihood of causing user-visible or operational failure.
- Documentation changes should be reviewed for factual correctness and consistency with the current workflow.

## Tool usage boundaries

- Use tool-specific implementations only as surfaces for the same conceptual roles.
- If a tool does not support named subagents, use the equivalent prompt template or local instruction file instead.
- Do not assume one vendor-specific feature exists in another tool.

## Workflow synchronization guardrail

When updating workflow stage names or order (for example the loop sequence), keep all canonical references synchronized in the same change.

Minimum sync targets:

- `AGENTS.md` loop string and numbered flow breakdown
- `docs/agent-playbook.md` three-layer loop summary and mandatory steps section
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` mandatory workflow steps
- `skills/demand-triage/SKILL.md` Small-path requirements
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry describing the workflow update

Do not leave stale stage names (for example `Read` as a standalone stage after switching to `Discover`) in any of these files.

## Project-specific constraints

<!-- Teams MUST fill this section when adopting the template. -->
<!-- Examples of concrete constraints: -->
<!-- - Use raw SQL with sqlc; no ORM -->
<!-- - Do not modify the DB schema without a migration file -->
<!-- - Pricing logic must use JSONB rule definitions -->
<!-- - All HTTP handlers must use the shared middleware stack -->
<!-- - Authentication uses JWT with RS256; do not switch algorithms -->
<!-- - Frontend state management uses Zustand; do not introduce Redux -->

_This section is intentionally blank in the template. Fill it with your repository's actual technical constraints, architectural decisions, and non-negotiable patterns._

## Decision log

Maintain a `DECISIONS.md` file (or equivalent) at the repository root to record:

- **What** was decided
- **Why** the decision was made (alternatives considered)
- **When** it was decided
- **Constraints** it introduces for future work

Agents should read this file during codebase discovery and append to it when making architectural or behavioral decisions that future work depends on.

### ADR automatic update

When a task changes system architecture (for example service boundary split/merge, integration pattern replacement, event topology change, deployment model change), agents must update architecture decision records in the same task.

Rules:

1. If `docs/adr/` exists, append or supersede an ADR in that directory.
2. If no ADR directory exists, append a full decision entry to `DECISIONS.md` and include architecture-change context.
3. Do not finalize implementation with architecture changes unless ADR/decision log is updated in the same change set.

### Decision archive lifecycle

When `DECISIONS.md` exceeds 50 entries or 30 KB, or when any memory health indicator reaches the "needs attention" threshold, archive inactive decisions to `DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md`. See `skills/memory-and-state/SKILL.md` → Memory lifecycle management for the full procedure, safety checks, and health indicators.

Key rules:
- Archive only entries whose constraints are no longer enforced by current code
- Never archive based on date alone
- Each archived entry must include the reason it was archived
- Agents read `DECISIONS.md` by default; read archive only when working with legacy modules or when contradiction detection finds no match in active decisions

### Mandatory read-before-write

Before making any architectural or behavioral decision, agents **must**:

1. Read `DECISIONS.md` in full
2. If the task involves legacy code or historical migrations, search `DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md` for related prior decisions if the archive file exists
3. Check whether the proposed change contradicts any relevant decision found in the active log or archive search results
4. If it contradicts: stop and present the contradiction to the user with both the existing decision and the proposed change. Do not silently override.

### Automatic decision capture

After any of these events, agents must append a new entry to `DECISIONS.md`:

- A new technology, library, or pattern is introduced
- A schema or contract is changed
- A permission or security model is modified
- An architectural boundary is created or moved
- A tradeoff is made (performance vs. readability, scope vs. timeline, etc.)

Use this format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD: [Decision title]
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Alternatives considered**: What was rejected and why
- **Constraints introduced**: What future work must respect
```

### Contradiction detection

If an agent discovers that a proposed change conflicts with an existing entry in `DECISIONS.md`:

```
## Contradiction detected
- **Existing decision**: [date and title from DECISIONS.md]
- **Proposed change**: [what the current task wants to do]
- **Conflict**: [why these are incompatible]
- **Options**: (a) follow existing decision, (b) reverse existing decision with justification

Waiting for user decision before proceeding.
```

This is a mandatory checkpoint — do not resolve contradictions autonomously. Exception: when `dangerouslySkipAllCheckpoints: true` is active, log the contradiction prominently and continue rather than stopping. The user's explicit bypass choice is treated as acknowledgment of this risk.

## Conflict resolution principle

When generic agent guidance conflicts with repository-specific practice, resolve in this order:

1. Explicit user instruction for the current task
2. Existing codebase practice and enforced repository constraints
3. Project Context (`project/project-manifest.md`, `Project-specific constraints`, active decisions)
4. Domain Rules
5. Global Rules and model default preferences

Default rule:

- If playbook guidance conflicts with existing repository style, follow existing repository practice unless the user explicitly requests a refactor.
