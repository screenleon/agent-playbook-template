# On Project Start

Use this skill only when entering a repository for the first time in a session or when project boundaries are still unclear.

## Goal

Convert unknown project boundaries into explicit, confirmed constraints before implementation starts.

## Protocol

1. Scan repository signals
- Inspect top-level files and dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`).
- Detect likely stack and runtime (for example Spring Boot, Django, React, Terraform, CDK).
- Detect validation commands from CI config (`.github/workflows/`, `Makefile`, `Justfile`, scripts).
- Check for existing conventions docs (`CONVENTIONS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.editorconfig`).

2. Ask targeted boundary questions
- Ask only high-value questions that can change implementation decisions.
- Prefer either/or questions when possible.
- Skip questions whose answers are already documented in existing project files.
- Examples:
  - "I detected Spring Boot. Is there a package naming standard I must follow?"
  - "I detected AWS IaC files. Should infrastructure changes use Terraform or CDK?"
  - "I see no test framework configured. Which testing approach should I use?"

3. Confirm and persist
- Summarize confirmed boundaries in concise bullets.
- Add or update `project/project-manifest.md` with the confirmed constraints.
- If a new durable architectural constraint is discovered, append to `DECISIONS.md`.

4. Continue with normal workflow
- Run `repo-exploration` then `demand-triage`.
- Do not start implementation until initialization questions are resolved or explicitly deferred by user instruction.

## Output format

```
Initialization summary:
- Detected stack:
- Boundary questions asked:
- User confirmations:
- Constraints recorded in project manifest:
- Open items (if any):
```

## Conformance self-check

- [ ] Stack signals were discovered from real files, not guessed
- [ ] At least one boundary question was asked when constraints were unclear
- [ ] Confirmed constraints were written to project context
- [ ] Workflow proceeded to discovery/triage before implementation
